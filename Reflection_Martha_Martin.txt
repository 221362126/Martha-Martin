This assignment helped me understand the process of building a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. I followed the video tutorial to guide the layout and design but personalized it with my own content and photo. One of the main challenges I faced was managing the project folder structure correctly, especially linking the image and CSS files. I also encountered and resolved syntax errors in the CSS file and a missing image issue due to a folder naming mistake. These experiences taught me how important it is to be precise with file paths, naming, and saving changes in VS Code. Overall, the process improved my confidence in web development and troubleshooting errors independently
